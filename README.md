# Intro-to-Database 675 
Hello there! I use this repo as a class notebook for the course Intro to Databases.

Here are some most famous databases now used in the industry : 

1. MySQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. MongoDB(Non-SQL)

Differnces between SQL and non-SQL:
SQL databases are relational databases that organize data into structured tables with predefined schemas. These tables consist of rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using foreign key constraints.
NoSQL databases, on the other hand, employ various data models, including document-based (e.g., MongoDB), key-value pairs (e.g., Redis), columnar (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and graph-based (e.g., Neo4j). NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data with dynamic schemas.
